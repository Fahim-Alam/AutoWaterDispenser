# AutoWaterDispensers
ENGR 0011 Semester PROJECT: Inventing a New Product/System to Help Combat Water Waste.
ENGR 0011: The algorithm(s) implementation of the remodeled sensor for current automatic water dispensers.

Problem(s) we observed: 
- People were taking longer showers.
- Turning on the sink while brushing their teeth or shaving.
- People leaving half-filled water bottles.  

The problem my team and I decided to tackle â€“ Improvise the Current Water Dispensers:
- We noticed how many students often use the water dispensers in their halls to refill their bottles. We observed that some students stayed distracted on their phones while the bottle was being filled, only to find out that dispensers overfilled their water bottles. Despite completely refilling the bottles, the water dispensers fail to detect that and continue to dispense water. At first glance, the small amount of water wasted may not be so significant, but considering how many students and faculties use the water dispensers to refill their water bottles, the amount of water wasted from the dispenser builds up exponentially, like compound interest.

"How Might We..." Question:
- How might we develop a system that prevents the water-refilling stations from over-filling bottles and wasting water?

Our proposed solution to the problem:
- Modify the current sensors to use a set of algorithms and the OpenCV module to scan the bottle, detect any liquid inside the bottle, both plastic, and metal, and dispense water accordingly until the bottle is filled.
- In addition, add manual buttons to allow the user to choose how much water they want to dispense.
